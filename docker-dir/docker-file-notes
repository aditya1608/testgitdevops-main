A Dockerfile is a text-based document that's used to create a container image. It provides instructions to the image builder on the commands to run, files to copy, startup command, and more.

Common instructions :

    Some of the most common instructions in a Dockerfile include:

    1. FROM <image> : this specifies the base image that the build will extend.
    
    2. WORKDIR <path> : this instruction specifies the "working directory" or the path in the image where files will be copied and 
                        commands will be executed.
    
    3. COPY <host-path> <image-path> : this instruction tells the builder to copy files from the host and put them into the container image.
    
    4. RUN <command> : this instruction tells the builder to run the specified command.
    
    5. ENV <name> <value> : this instruction sets an environment variable that a running container will use.
    
    6. EXPOSE <port-number> : this instruction sets configuration on the image that indicates a port the image would like to
                              expose.
    
    7. USER <user-or-uid> : this instruction sets the default user for all subsequent instructions.
    
    8. CMD ["<command>", "<arg1>"] : this instruction sets the default command a container using this image will run.
