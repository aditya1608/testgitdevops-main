Now we will learn how to push our images in Docker Hub Repository

1. First step is to create account in Docker Hub : 
        Link : https://hub.docker.com/login

2. Now create a Public repository by any name. Remember don't create Private repository because it's not free and you have 
   to pay for Private Repo 

3. Now login in to the Docker account through EC2 instance :
        command :  docker login
        Enter you username and password and if all credentials are correct it will show login successfull

4. If you want to push your code into the Docker Hub repository remember you image name and the repository name should be same.

5. If the image and repo name is not same then run the following command :
      Suppose my image name is : nginx:v1 
      Your repo name is : rajpalsaini/nginx-repo

6. So, run the below command to change your image name so that I will be the same name as your repo name :
      command : docker tag nginx:v1 rajpalsaini/nginx-repo:v1
      where,
            nginx:v1 is your image name
            rajpalsaini/nginx-repo:v1 is your Docker Hub repository name
