# nginx image in Ubuntu

# Creating a nginx image from ubuntu image
# Ubuntu Base image
FROM ubuntu:20.04   

# You can run multiple Linux commands using COPY option
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install nginx -y

# COPY <source> <destination> (Copy the file from local to container)
COPY index.html /var/www/html

# We can expose multiple ports also EXPOSE 80,8080,93 like this
EXPOSE 80

# To start the NGINX service we cannot run systemctl command because containers runs on the single process and it doesn't
# have systemd process(daemon process). So, we have find another way to run this nginx service.
# Open this file first vi /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nginx.service
# In this file search for this line ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g 'daemon on; master_process on;'
# /usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g 'daemon on; master_process on;' this command will be used to start the NGINX service

CMD [ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" ]
#CMD ["nginx"]

# Docker command to Build the file
Syntax :  docker build -t <tag-name> <file-name>
          where,
                t = tagname

          Example : docker build -t nginx:v1 dockerfile

# After running the above command you will find your image by using the docker images command
# Now, to run this image use the command below

docker run -d -p 82:80 nginx:v1

# Remember to add port no 82 in the EC2 instance security group. If not added it will not work
# Now last step is to test the web server by using the EC2 instance URL
